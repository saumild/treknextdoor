<h4><b>Activity Information</b></h4><br>


<b>Itinerary Details</b><br>
<b>Day1:</b>
Participants meet at Kathgodam Railway Station and head to the base of the trek, Lohajung. The drive takes them through popular hill stations of Bhimtal and Almora. Bhimtal is the sister town of Nainital and Almora is a beautiful and historic town of the Kumaon region, which was founded in 1568. The overnight stay at Lohajung is in either a guest house or a permanent camp.<br>	
<b>Day2:</b>The trek begins with a walk to Didna. The trail to the Didna starts with a steady climb up the Lohajung Pass, then there's a descent till Bedni River. The Bedni River is also known as Bedni Ganga, as it is considered sacred by the locals. After crossing a bridge, there is a gradual climb through a forest of Oak and Bamboo. The views from Didna are spectacular and the trail to the village is also extremely picturesque, which will delight participants who are also shutterbugs. Overnight stay in tents or homestays.
After breakfast proceed to Trekking.	<br>
<b>Day3:</b>
Today’s trail is filled with steep ascents. After climbing for a bit, the majestic views of the Garhwal Himalayas greet the participants. The trail then passes through a forest of bamboo and oak, eventually ending at Ali Bugyal, which is a beautiful grazing meadow that lies on top of a hill. Overnight stay is in tents.	<br>
<b>Day4:</b>
After a moderate ascent, the trail is fairly easy today. Within a few hours, participants cross over to the other side of the ridge line from where the views get even better. The trail weaves through undulating meadows and up to to a place called Ghora Lotani. Overnight stay is in tents.<br>
<b>Day5:</b>The participants climb to over 13,000 feet today. Today's trek may stretch the body a bit, and trekkers may feel symptoms of high-altitude sickness like shortness of breath, mild headache and tiredness. This is a part of high-altitude trekking and the effects are not permanent. They are advised to trek slowly and steadily and take water breaks every hour. It is very important to stay hydrated. A steep, winding trail leads participants to Kalu Vinayak. Overnight stay is in tents.<br>
<b>Day6:</b>Today is the day where participants will trek to the Roopkund Lake - the mysterious 'skeletal' lake. The day starts at 4:00 am as the snow is hard due to lower temperatures making it easy to negotiate without getting the shoes drenched. The lake is a 3 km moderate climb from Bhagwabasa. The end of the trail has a very steep ascent. The 3 kms take about 3 to 3.5 hrs to negotiate. A further climb of around 20 minutes takes participants to the highest point of Roopkund Lake Trek, i.e. Junargali. From there, participants head back to the campsite in Patharnachauni.<br>
<b>Day7:</b>The meadows end once participants cross Bedini Bugyal. On a clear day, Mt. Trishul is visible in all its glory. There is a steep descent and a short climb from Bedni Bugyal. The trail takes trekkers through a beautiful rhododendron forest. On reaching Wan village, participants are driven to Lohajung.<br>
<b>Day8:</b>The last day of the trek ends with a drive from Lohajung to Kathgodam. Although participants get to the station by 5:00 pm, it is advisable to book onward journey tickets only after 8:00 pm.<br>
